Retail Data Analytics Optimization Platform: Snowflake & AWS Ecosystem Integration

1. Managed over 100 million records across distinct datasets (sales, inventory, store, etc.) for efficient analytics.
2. Established a snowflake-schema data model, comprising 3 dimension tables and 2 fact tables, enhancing data loading and query handling through DDL and DML.
3. Utilized Snowflake to simulate a transaction database environment, dumping raw data into an AWS S3 bucket daily, saving 80% of the traditional preliminary data handling time.
4. Enhanced data readiness detection accuracy by 50% through multi-file ETL architecture using AWS Cloudwatch & Lambda.
5. Authored PySpark scripts in the EMR environment to perform data transformations, reducing processing time by 40%. Integrated Athena and Glue with the S3 bucket, boosting data accessibility and reducing retrieval time by 60%.
6. Employed Apache Superset as the BI tool for data visualization, improving interpretation by 30%, and integrated transformed data into
7. Redshift for immediate analytics, boosting overall performance.
8. Utilized Git/GitHub for source code management and implemented CI/CD pipelines, bolstering collaboration, enhancing system reliability, and expediting deployment time.
